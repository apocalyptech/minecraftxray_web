 * Figure out transparency rendering glitches, and start using the
   transparent leaf texture for trees once that's been figured out.  Right
   now they look better with the solid texture.  In particular, all the
   "decorative" blocks like torches, flowers, reed, etc, look weird, as
   does water and portals.  As it turns out, this is all to do with OpenGL
   alpha blending; in addition to a couple quick calls to glDepthMask (see
   renderSolid() in Chunk.java), we then need to make sure that all GL
   objects are rendered from far-away to near, which will take some doing.
   
 * Proper rendering support for redstone wire
 
 * Draw messages on signs like you'd expect.
 
 * GUI to set custom key bindings and custom ore highlights
 
 * Find a way to eliminate the stuttering when new map chunks are loading
 
 * Home/End will wipe the minimap and load chunks, even if we're already
   "in range" and might even have those chunks cached.  Should fix that.
   
 * Minimap effective size has been cut quite a bit, would like to increase that
 
 * Would be nice to have a check when warping between Nether and Overworld
   to make sure you don't end up off-map
   
 * There are various conditions where the player position and spawn position
   markers won't show up properly on the minimap; should fix those.
 
 * As I've been editing the X-Ray code, I've been using underscore_variables like
   that, mostly, instead of the camelCase which was more prevalent.  Should really
   reformat everything to a single style (and retab the whole thing, and clean up
   formatting and style in general).  And really, I've been pretty lazy all around
   with doing things the "right way."  The code could use cleanup in general.  Also
   I think most of the files are still using DOS line-endings.
 
 * Hotkey to re-open the "Open" dialog and load a new world
 
 * And, of course, completing the mod support - UI to select extra mod files, etc.
   "override" to explicitly override a previously-defined blocktype (this is
   technically in there already but completely untested), "version" so that people
   could override the builtin blockdef more efficiently, if they want, etc...
 
 * Technically the minimap colors for a few block types should vary based on the
   data value.
 
 * There's attributes in BlockType which use ArrayList, and I think I'd rather they
   just be arrays.  Should look into that.
 
 * Pull the grass colorization color from a point on misc/grasscolor.png

 * Snow has data, as it turns out...

 * Figure out why loading in nonexistant chunks seems to glitch the app so much

 * Update position information popup in realtime rather than after a delay
 
 * The resolution-picking dialog has some issues in Java7.  One, the dropdowns
   seem very sluggish, whereas on previous JDKs they're quite fast.  Two (and
   possibly relatedly), our hotkeys (enter and escape) only work so long as the
   dialog has NEVER actually had the mouse pointer focused on top of it, at
   least on my WM.  This could potentially have something to do with my
   focus-follows-mouse type setup, but it works totally fine in both Java5 and
   Java6, so...
