X-Ray redistributes the following components:

  * LWJGL
    http://lwjgl.org/
    This is also distributed under the the new/modified BSD license, though
    specific details can be found in COPYING-lwjgl.txt.
    
  * launch4j
    http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/
    This is used for Windows EXE generation, and is available under a BSD
    license.  It also appears to include code under the MIT license, and
    includes some binaries licensed under the GPL.  See COPYING-launch4j.txt
    for more details on that.

  * SnakeYAML
    http://code.google.com/p/snakeyaml/
    Available under the Apache License 2.0.  See COPYING-snakeyaml.txt for more
    details on that.

  * log4j
    http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/
    Also available under the Apache License 2.0.  See COPYING-log4j.txt for
    more details on that.

  * Various files from Minecraft's builtin texturepack
    http://www.minecraft.net/
    Specifically: terrain.png, particles.png, art/kz.png, and misc/water.png
    Technically this redistribution is in violation of Mojang's stated 
    "Do not distribute anything we've made" rule, but I'm pretty sure that
    this kind of usage would be acceptible regardless, especially given that
    the bundled texturepack is only used in extreme corner cases where the
    user's installed minecraft.jar can't be found on the drive.  Plus, many
    other prominent community tools have been bundling terrain.png for some
    time now (INVedit, MCEdit, etc).  Ah, the "everyone else was doing it"
    argument!  Anyway, I will of course readily cease using the official
    texturepack in here if asked.

    They appear to be under a sort of generic public domain license.

In general, the X-Ray sourcecode files here will list a copyright for both
Vincent Vollers and CJ Kucera, though the actual distribution of code copyright
would probably be more complicated than that.  Please forgive any instances of
code misattribution!
